Warning: Design 'riscv' contains 1 high-fanout nets. A fanout number of 1000 will be used for delay calculations involving these nets. (TIM-134)
     Net 'dp/rf/clk': 1218 load(s), 1 driver(s)
Information: State dependent leakage is now switched from off to on.
Information: Propagating switching activity (low effort zero delay simulation). (PWR-6)
